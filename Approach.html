            <h3 id="top" class="big-title">The Logic of Theology</h3>
            <h4><b>Purpose</b>: Faith Seeking Understanding</h4>
            <p>Theologians seek to magnify, clarify, justify, and apply the Truth about God and His relationship to the world as revealed in Creation, Canon, and Christ.</p>
            
            <h4><b>Key Questions</b>: Faith Seeking Answers</h4>
            <p>Theologians ask and provide disciplined answers to clusters of questions related to (1) the Classical Arguments for God, (2) the Skeptical Attacks on God, (3) the Personal Attributes of God, (4) the Historical Actions of God and (5) our Practical Allegiance to God.</p>
            
            <h4>Information: Faith Seeking Reasons</h4>
            <p>Theologians employ a wide range of sources in the construction and critique of their theological systems, reflecting differing confessional starting points (e.g., Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant), varying methodological approaches (e.g., Systematic, Historical, Practical) and contrasting personal temperaments (e.g., Analytical, Artistic, Emotional).  Typically, however, most theologians seek to ground their thinking in Scripture, Tradition, Reason and/or Experience.  And while opinions vary among scholars on the relative value and legitimacy of using any or all of the last three (i.e., tradition, reason, experience), all Christian theologians agree in elevating Scripture to a unique, authoritative and canonical (i.e., ruling, measuring) status as a source for theologizing.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Concepts:  Faith Seeking Language</h4>
            <p>Over the millenia, theologians have developed a highly specialized vocabulary for capturing and communicating the most significant concepts explored in the process of their theologizing.  At one level, all of these concepts (and their corresponding labels) can be categorized under the three organizing themes of God, Man and Salvation.  But these three overarching categories can, in turn, be divided into twelve more precisely defined clusters of concepts covering the entire spectrum of theological investigation.  These include:  Theology (Proper), Patrology, Christology, Pneumatology, Protology, Cosmology, Bibliology, Anthropology, Harmartiology, Soteriology, Ecclesiology and Eschatology.</p>
            
            <h4>Assumptions:  Faith Seeking Foundations</h4>
            <p>At the heart of the theological enterprise are Three Central Paradoxes that provide theologians a set of presuppositions regarding (a) the unique "Object" of all theological study (i.e., God),  (b) the persistent threat to "Objectivity" in every theological student (i.e., the human mind) and (c) the main "Objectives" of most theological studies (i.e., orthodoxy/orthopraxy).  Only by assuming both the Incomprehensibility and the Comprehensibility of God--the Paradox of the Knowability of God--can theologians initiate the search for valid claims about Him.  Similarly, only by assuming that the human mind possesses reliable but restricted capacities to think about God--the Paradox of the Knowing Ability of Man--can theologians temper their claims with the proper balance of confidence and caution.  And it's only by assuming that our beliefs and behaviors are intimately connected--the Paradox of the Knowable Accountability of Man to God--that we can properly value the theological enterprise.</p>
            
            <h4>Inferences:  Faith Seeking Coherence</h4>
            <p>Theology, like all disciplines, proceeds my means of methodological strategies designed to help theologians move from the foundational sources of their subject (i.e., Scripture, Tradition, Reason and Experience) to valid claims and conclusions in a highly disciplined way.  And while such methods vary to some extent across confessional lines, it's helpful to think of "theologizing" (i.e., the process of making reliable theological inferences from recognized authoritative sources by means of rational deduction, induction and abduction) as a form of thinking that is premised on authoritative sources (e.g., Scripture, Tradition, etc.), pursued through various methodological strategies (e.g., Exegetical, Historical, etc.) and productive in yielding an array of practical resources (e.g., Creeds, Confessions, etc.) for the Church.  Through their inference-making, theologians seek logical consistency, systematic coherence, philosophical clarity and ethical credibility for their theological claims.</p>
            
            <h4>Implications:  Faith Seeking Significance</h4>
            <p>Theology's significance is in large part determined by the implications flowing from the conclusions reached in the process of theologizing.  As such, the ramifications of the discipline can, in one sense, only be measured in terms of the vast number of claims made by all of the varied and particular theological systems.  And yet, the discipline as a whole--regardless of the historical, confessional or philosophical distinctives of those engaged in it--yields a number of key implications for our view of the Creator, the value of His Creation and our vocation as His Creatures in relationship to both.  In particular, Theology implies the existence of a personal, moral and relational God who stands above and behind a world of incalculable worth as a created medium of communion between its Maker--God--and its God-Imaging Manager--Man.</p>
            
            <h4>Point of View:  Faith Seeking Perspective</h4>
            <p>Many factors contribute to the final version of any theological system, claim or conclusion.  But few are more important than the point of view(s) from which the theologian works.  And for most theologians, point of view is provided by four distinct (but usually related) orientations that guide them in their work:  (1) the Biblical Narrative provides Theology with its Framework; (2) Confessional Norms provide it with a Flavor; (3) Historical Needs provide it with Focus; and (4) Cultural Nuances often provide it a distinct Form.  From these four overarching orientations, theologians seek to conceive and construct theological theories marked by fidelity to Scripture, serviceability to the Church, continuity with Tradition and credibility for Society.</p>

        <h3 id="Inferences">Inferences:  Faith Seeking Coherence</h3>
            <p>Theology, like all disciplines, proceeds my means of methodological strategies designed to help theologians move from the foundational sources of their subject (i.e., Scripture, Tradition, Reason and Experience) to valid claims and conclusions in a highly disciplined way.  And while such methods vary to some extent across confessional lines, it's helpful to think of "theologizing" (i.e., the process of making reliable theological inferences from recognized authoritative sources by means of rational deduction, induction and abduction) as a form of thinking that is premised on authoritative sources (e.g., Scripture, Tradition, etc.), pursued through various methodological strategies (e.g., Exegetical, Historical, etc.) and productive in yielding an array of practical resources (e.g., Creeds, Confessions, etc.) for the Church.  Through their inference-making, theologians seek logical consistency, systematic coherence, philosophical clarity and ethical credibility for their theological claims.</p>    
            <h4>I. Theological Inferences can be Grounded on Various Premises</h4>
            <p><b>A. Theological Beliefs should Arise from Scripture</b><br>
                Example: Mary = Virgin Mother of Jesus<br><br>
            
            <b>B. Theological Beliefs should Accord with Tradition</b><br>
                Example: Mary = Co-Redemptrix with Jesus<br><br>
                
            <b>C. Theological Beliefs should Agree with Reason</b><br>
                Example: Mary = Maiden Mother of Jesus<br><br>
                
            <b>D. Theological Beliefs should Articulate our Experience</b><br>
                Example: Mary = Visionary Surrogate for Jesus<br><br>
            </p>    
            
            <h4>II. Theological Inferences can be Guided by Various Processes</h4>    
            <p><b>A. Exegetical Theology = Inferring about the Data in a Text</b><br>
                Main Questions:  What did this Data Mean?  Why?<br>
                Example: Argument of Galatians or Revelation.<br><br>
                
                <b>B. Biblical Theology = Inferring about a Document in the Canon</b><br>
                Main Questions:  What does this Document Teach?  Why?<br>
                Example: Argument of Galatians or Revelation.<br><br>
                
                <b>C. Historical Theology = Inferring about Dogmas from the Past</b><br>
                Main Questions:  What did Past Ages Believe?  Why?<br>
                Example:  Calvinism vs. Arminiansim on Election<br><br>
                
                <b>D. Systematic Theology = Inferring about Doctrine on an Issue</b><br>
                Main Questions:  What should We Believe?  Why?<br>
                Example:  Inclusivism vs. Exclusivism and Salvation<br><br>
                
                <b>E. Confessional Theology = Inferring about Distinctives of a Sect</b><br>
                Main Questions:  What does this Sect Believe?  Why?<br>
                Example:  Methodists vs. Baptists as Denominations<br><br>
                
                <b>F. Practical Theology  = Inferring about the Duties of a Disciple</b><br>
                Main Questions:  What should Disciples Do?  Why?<br>
                Example:  Pacifism vs. Just War during War<br><br>
            </p>
                
                
            <h4>III. Theological Inferences can Grow into Various Products</h4>
                <p><b>A. Creeds - Confessions - Catechisms</b> (Focused on the Head)<br>
                   <b>B. Liturgies - Literatures - Catechisms</b> (Focused on the Heart)<br>
                   <b>C. Missions - Morals - Ministries</b> (Focused on the Hands)<br>
                </p>
            
            <h3 id="Implications">Implications:  Faith Seeking Significance</h3>
            <p>Theology's significance is in large part determined by the implications flowing from the conclusions reached in the process of theologizing.  As such, the ramifications of the discipline can, in one sense, only be measured in terms of the vast number of claims made by all of the varied and particular theological systems.  And yet, the discipline as a whole--regardless of the historical, confessional or philosophical distinctives of those engaged in it--yields a number of key implications for our view of the Creator, the value of His Creation and our vocation as His Creatures in relationship to both.  In particular, Theology implies the existence of a personal, moral and relational God who stands above and behind a world of incalculable worth as a created medium of communion between its Maker--God--and its God-Imaging Manager--Man.</p>

                  <b>D. That Its Openness -- to Moves by its Maker -- Heightens its Value</b><br>
                   1. Because it allows God to Providentially Influence Us<br>

            <h3 id="POV">Point of View:  Faith Seeking Perspective</h3>
            <p>Many factors contribute to the final version of any theological system, claim or conclusion.  But few are more important than the point of view(s) from which the theologian works.  And for most theologians, point of view is provided by four distinct (but usually related) orientations that guide them in their work:  (1) the Biblical Narrative provides Theology with its Framework; (2) Confessional Norms provide it with a Flavor; (3) Historical Needs provide it with Focus; and (4) Cultural Nuances often provide it a distinct Form.  From these four overarching orientations, theologians seek to conceive and construct theological theories marked by fidelity to Scripture, serviceability to the Church, continuity with Tradition and credibility for Society.</p>
            
            <h4>I. Biblical Narrative provides the Framework for Theology's Point of View</h4>
